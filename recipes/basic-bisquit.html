    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="description">Looking for a homemade biscuit recipe that's perfect for beginners
        and experienced cooks alike? Your search ends here. This tried-and-true
        recipe is beloved by the Allrecipes community because it's easy to make
        with just five ingredients, it calls for kitchen staples you probably
        already have on hand, and it's absolutely delicious.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="list-header">Flour: </span>All-purpose flour holds the ingredients
            together. Also, the protein in flour (when combined with moisture and heat) 
            creates gluten, which provides structure.</li>
        <li><span class="list-header">Baking Powder: </span>Baking powder, not yeast, is used 
            as a leavener in this easy biscuit recipe. It causes the dough to expand, giving 
            the biscuits volume and texture.</li>
        <li><span class="list-header">Salt: </span>Salt acts as a flavor enhancer and it 
            strengthens the protein in the dough.</li>
        <li><span class="list-header">Shortening: </span>Shortening is made of purely fat, 
            unlike butter which contains water and milk solids. This means it's better at 
            reducing (or "shortening!") gluten strands, resulting in a soft and crumbly 
            biscuit.</li>
        <li><span class="list-header">Milk: </span>Cold milk adds moisture, flavor, and 
            structure to the biscuit dough</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><span class="list-header">Prepare the Dough: </span>Sift the dry ingredients 
            (flour, baking powder, and salt) into a large bowl. Cut in the shortening, 
            then add the milk. Mix until the dough is soft and doesn't stick to the side 
            of the bowl.</li>
        <li><span class="list-header">Knead and Roll: </span>Turn the dough out onto a lightly 
            floured surface and knead briefly. Roll the dough into an even sheet that's about 
            Â½-inch thick.</li>
        <li><span class="list-header">Cut and Bake: </span>Use a lightly floured biscuit cutter 
            to cut out the biscuits. Place the cut biscuits on an ungreased baking sheet. 
            Re-roll the dough, repeating the cutting process, until all the dough is gone. 
            Bake in an oven preheated to 450 degrees F until golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
