    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Looking for a homemade biscuit recipe that's perfect for beginners
        and experienced cooks alike? Your search ends here. This tried-and-true
        recipe is beloved by the Allrecipes community because it's easy to make
        with just five ingredients, it calls for kitchen staples you probably
        already have on hand, and it's absolutely delicious.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><b>Flour</b></p>
            <p>All-purpose flour holds the ingredients together. Also, the protein
                in flour (when combined with moisture and heat) creates gluten,
                which provides structure.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Baking Powder</b></p>
            <p>Baking powder, not yeast, is used as a leavener in this easy biscuit
                recipe. It causes the dough to expand, giving the biscuits volume
                and texture.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Salt</b></p>
            <p>Salt acts as a flavor enhancer and it strengthens the protein in the dough.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Shortening</b></p>
            <p>Shortening is made of purely fat, unlike butter which contains water and
                milk solids. This means it's better at reducing (or "shortening!")
                gluten strands, resulting in a soft and crumbly biscuit.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Milk</b></p>
            <p>Cold milk adds moisture, flavor, and structure to the biscuit dough.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p><b>Prepare the Dough</b></p>
            <p>Sift the dry ingredients (flour, baking powder, and salt) into a large bowl.
                Cut in the shortening, then add the milk. Mix until the dough is soft and
                doesn't stick to the side of the bowl.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p><b>Knead and Roll</b></p>
            <p>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead briefly. Roll
                the dough into an even sheet that's about Â½-inch thick.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Cut and Bake</b></p>
            <p>Use a lightly floured biscuit cutter to cut out the biscuits. Place the cut
                biscuits on an ungreased baking sheet. Re-roll the dough, repeating the
                cutting process, until all the dough is gone. Bake in an oven preheated
                to 450 degrees F until golden brown.</p>
