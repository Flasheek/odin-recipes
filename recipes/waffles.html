    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="description">This waffle recipe is the only one you'll need to make homemade waffles
        with your waffle iron. Simple pantry ingredients mix up quickly in this
        easy batter that can be used right away or stored in the refrigerator
        for up to a week. Serve waffles hot with whipped cream and fresh fruit
        or with butter and maple syrup for either breakfast, brunch, or a snack.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="list-header">Eggs:</span> This waffle recipe starts with two whole eggs, whisked until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><span class="list-header">Flour:</span> All-purpose flour adds gluten, which gives the waffles structure. You can also use whole
            wheat flour.</li>
        <li><span class="list-header">Milk:</span> Whole milk lends richness and moisture. Plus, it helps create the ideal batter consistency.
        </li>
        <li><span class="list-header">Oil:</span> A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, ensures the waffles are nice and moist.</li>
        <li><span class="list-header">Sugar:</span> A tablespoon of white sugar adds the perfect amount of sweetness.</li>
        <li><span class="list-header">Baking powder:</span> Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it contributes to the waffles' light
            and fluffy texture.</li>
        <li><span class="list-header">Salt:</span> A pinch of salt enhances the other flavors. Don't skip this step!</li>
        <li><span class="list-header">Vanilla:</span> A dash of vanilla adds complexity and enhances the overfall flavor.</li>
        <li><span class="list-header">Cooking spray:</span> You'll need to spray the iron with nonstick cooking spray before you start making
            the waffles.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><span class="list-header">Make the batter:</span> Whisk the eggs, then add the flour, milk, and oil. Whisk in the sugar. Stir in the remaining ingredients.</li>
        <li><span class="list-header">Make the waffles:</span> Pour the batter onto the hot, prepared waffle iron. Cook until golden brown and repeat with the remaining batter.</li>
    </ol>
